# Tonalities, a Polifonia pilot project

*Tonalities is developing tools for the modal-tonal identification, exploration and classification of monophonic and polyphonic notated music from the Renaissance to the 20th century. The pilot has a broader societal and pedagogical dimension: it does not only impact research on the theory and evolution of the musical language but is also relevant for the understanding of music collections by students, performers, and informed music lovers. The recording industry is a potential target for the classification of works and the constitution of playlists.*

### Two complementary interaction modes
- **Inspection** mode allows to pick a specific element from the score and view its metadatas.
- **SÃ©lection** mode allows to agregate elements which form a selection.

### Three element types to be selected or inspected from the score
- A **note** (structural unit)
- A **verticality** (temporal unit)
- A **positioned note** (conjunction between a note and a verticality)

### Selections can be edited and reused
Selections regroup elements from the score but can also reuse previous selections.
